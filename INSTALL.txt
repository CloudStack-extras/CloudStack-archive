This document describes how to set up and configure a single server CloudStack development environment. If you aren't looking for a development environment The easiest way is to deploy CloudStack from RPM package, building CloudStack from source is for developers. This guide is all about building CloudStack from the source and installing directly from there . This guide is suitable for you if you want to develop the CloudStack.

I have tested this procedure on Fedora Core 14 

Step 1: Install the tools and dependencies: 
For fedora the package names are ant ant-devel, openjdk, openjdk-devel 

Tools:
yum install ant ant-devel openjdk openjdk-devel mysql mysql-server tomcat

Dependencies:
yum install jakarta-commons-collections jakarta-commons-dbcp.noarch apache-commons-logging.noarch jakarta-commons-pool jakarta-commons-httpclient.noarch ws-commons-util.noarch glibc-devel gcc python MySQL-python openssh-clients

Tomcat:
Download tomcat6.0.33 from http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-6/v6.0.33/bin/ instead of using distribution's default tomcat. Set CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE to path where you extract tomcat in environment variable, it would be better off setting them in .bashrc as it will take effect every time you log in.

Note: Tomcat6.0.35 has some known issue with CloudStack, please avoid it

SSHKEY:
Run:
sh-keygen -t rsa -q
to create sshkey for your account if you don't have one

Step 2: Configuration

Start the MySQL service :

# service mysqld start

Step 3: Get the source

$ git clone https://github.com/CloudStack/CloudStack.git

For subsequent pulls, do:
$ git pull

Step 4: Building, testing, and deploying CloudStack using Ant :

Ant is a Java-based build tool designed to be cross-platform, easy to use, extensible, and scalable. Ant is controlled by providing a text file that tells how to perform all the stages of building, testing, and deploying a project. These files are build files, and every project that uses Ant must have at least one named as build.xml. You can see build.xml in your CloudStack source.

Type to build CloudStack :
$ ant clean-all build-all

Type to deploy mgt server :
$ ant  deploy-server

Type to deploy database :
$ ant deploydb

Type to run mgt server:
$ ant debug

If all of the above process is successful. You are done the single server CloudStack installation.Now your CloudStack Management Server is running.

Open your browser and type the bellow url in address bar:

http://localhost:8080/client/

OR

http://management-server-ip-address:8080/client

You can see CloudStack Management Console page via a web browser.  It will show you management consle login page. You can use the default username and password and leave domain as blank.

The default credentials are “admin” for user and “password” for password. The domain field should be left blank. A blank
domain field is defaulted to the ROOT domain.

NOTE : This document is very basic CloudStack development installation. If you are very new to CloudStack and want to feel the power of CloudStack very quickly in RPM based distro, this document will guide very clear step to get it done. Since I am new to CloudStack, I doing this documentation by learning from community. I will keet update new information in this guide to make it more valuable resource.
