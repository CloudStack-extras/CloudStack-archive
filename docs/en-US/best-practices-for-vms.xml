  <title>Best Practices for Virtual Machines</title>
  <para>The &PRODUCT; administrator should monitor the total number of VM instances in each
    cluster, and disable allocation to the cluster if the total is approaching the maximum that
    the hypervisor can handle. Be sure to leave a safety margin to allow for the possibility of
    one or more hosts failing, which would increase the VM load on the other hosts as the VMs
    are automatically redeployed. Consult the documentation for your chosen hypervisor to find
    the maximum permitted number of VMs per host, then use &PRODUCT; global configuration
    settings to set this as the default limit. Monitor the VM activity in each cluster at all
    times. Keep the total number of VMs below a safe level that allows for the occasional host
    failure. For example, if there are N hosts in the cluster, and you want to allow for one
    host in the cluster to be down at any given time, the total number of VM instances you can
    permit in the cluster is at most (N-1) * (per-host-limit). Once a cluster reaches this
    number of VMs, use the &PRODUCT; UI to disable allocation of more VMs to the
    cluster.</para>
