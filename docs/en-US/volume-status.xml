<section id="volume-status">
  <title>Volume Status</title>
  <para>When a snapshot operation is triggered by means of a recurring snapshot
    policy, a snapshot is skipped if a volume has remained inactive since its
    last snapshot was taken. A volume is considered to be inactive if it is 
    either detached or attached to a VM that is not running. &PRODUCT; ensures
    that at least one snapshot is taken since the volume last became inactive.
  </para>
  <para>When a snapshot is taken manually, a snapshot is always created
    regardless of whether a volume has been active or not.
