  <title>Add Cluster: vSphere</title>
  <para>Host management for vSphere is done through a combination of vCenter and the &PRODUCT; admin
    UI. &PRODUCT; requires that all hosts be in a &PRODUCT; cluster, but the cluster may consist of
    a single host. As an administrator you must decide if you would like to use clusters of one host
    or of multiple hosts. Clusters of multiple hosts allow for features like live migration.
    Clusters also require shared storage such as NFS or iSCSI.</para>
  <para>For vSphere servers, we recommend creating the cluster of hosts in vCenter and then adding
    the entire cluster to &PRODUCT;. Follow these requirements:</para>
