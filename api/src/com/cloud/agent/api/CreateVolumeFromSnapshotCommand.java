     * 1) Get the parent chain of this VHD all the way up to the root, say VHDList
     * 2) Copy all the files in the VHDlist to some temp location
     * 3) Coalesce all the VHDs to one VHD which contains all the data of the volume. This invokes the DeletePreviousBackupCommand for each VHD
     * 4) Rename the UUID of this VHD
     * 5) Move this VHD to primary storage
     * 6) Rename the UUID of this VHD to a new one
     * 7) Introduce a VDI with this new VHD and return it.
