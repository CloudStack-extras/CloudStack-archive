/**
 * ConnectionException is thrown by Listeners while processing the startup
 * command.  There are two uses for this exception and they are distinguished
 * by the boolean flag.
 *   1. If the flag is set to true, there is an unexpected error during the
 *      processing.  Upon receiving this exception, the AgentManager will
 *      immediately place the agent under alert.  When the function to enable
 *      to disable the agent, the agent is disabled.
 *   2. If the flag is set to false, the listener has decided that the resource
 *      should be disconnected and reconnected to "refresh" all resource 
 *      information.  This is useful when the Listener needed to perform setup
 *      on the agent and decided it is best to flush connection and reconnect.
 *      It is important that the Listener does not fall into a loop in this
 *      situation where it keeps throwing ConnectionException.
