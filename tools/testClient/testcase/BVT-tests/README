Build Verification Testing (BVT) Cases
--------------------------------------
The test cases are the core functionality tests that ensure the application is stable and can be handed over to the QA for testing.
The BVT cases definitions are located at : https://docs.google.com/a/cloud.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak8acbfxQG8ndEppOGZSLV9mUF9idjVkTkZkajhTZkE&invite=CPij0K0L


Guidelines for developing Tests
-------------------------------
BVT test cases are being developed using Python's unittests2. Following are the guidelines being followed:
    1. Tests exercised for the same resource should ideally be present under a single suite or file. eg.
        All tests related VMs should ideally be present in a same test suite.

    2. Time-consuming operations that create new cloud resources like servers, volumes etc 
        should not necessarily be exercised per unit test. The resources can be created once and will be shared
        by all the unit tests in the test suite. 

    3. Certain tests pertaining to NAT, Firewall and Load Balancing warrant fresh resources per test. Hence a call should be
        taken by the stakeholders regarding sharing resources in such scenarios.

    4. Ensure that the functions are in place that clean up all the resources created during the test run.

BVT Test Files
--------------
The following files contain these BVT cases:

1. test_vm_life_cycle.py contains all the  VM Life Cycle tests
2. test_volumes.py contains all the Volumes related tests
