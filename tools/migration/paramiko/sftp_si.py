    This class defines an interface for controlling the behavior of paramiko

    Methods on this class are called from the SFTP session's thread, so you can
    block as long as necessary without affecting other sessions (even other
    SFTP sessions).  However, raising an exception will usually cause the SFTP
    session to abruptly end, so you will usually want to catch exceptions and
    return an appropriate error code.
    
    All paths are in string form instead of unicode because not all SFTP
    clients & servers obey the requirement that paths be encoded in UTF-8.

        on the file (read, write, etc).  On failure, an error code such as
        L{SFTP_PERMISSION_DENIED} should be returned.

        C{flags} contains the requested mode for opening (read-only,
        write-append, etc) as a bitset of flags from the C{os} module:

        not normally present in C{os.stat} results.  The method
        L{SFTPAttributes.from_stat} will usually do what you want.
