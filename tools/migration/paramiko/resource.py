    A registry of objects and resources that should be closed when those
    objects are deleted.
    
    This is meant to be a safer alternative to python's C{__del__} method,
    which can cause reference cycles to never be collected.  Objects registered
    with the ResourceManager can be collected but still free resources when
    they die.
    
    Resources are registered using L{register}, and when an object is garbage
    collected, each registered resource is closed by having its C{close()}
    method called.  Multiple resources may be registered per object, but a
    resource will only be closed once, even if multiple objects register it.
    (The last object to register it wins.)
