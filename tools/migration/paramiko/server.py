        unless this method returns C{OPEN_SUCCEEDED} -- once a
        L{Channel} object is created, you can call L{Channel.get_id} to

        L{Channel} object is created, you can call L{Channel.get_id} to
        retrieve the channel ID.

        The origin and destination parameters are (ip_address, port) tuples
        that correspond to both ends of the TCP connection in the forwarding
        tunnel.

        The return value should either be C{OPEN_SUCCEEDED} (or
        C{0}) to allow the channel request, or one of the following error
        codes to reject it:
            - C{OPEN_FAILED_ADMINISTRATIVELY_PROHIBITED}
            - C{OPEN_FAILED_CONNECT_FAILED}
            - C{OPEN_FAILED_UNKNOWN_CHANNEL_TYPE}
            - C{OPEN_FAILED_RESOURCE_SHORTAGE}
        
        The default implementation always returns
        C{OPEN_FAILED_ADMINISTRATIVELY_PROHIBITED}.
