"""
I{Paramiko} (a combination of the esperanto words for "paranoid" and "friend")
is a module for python 2.3 or greater that implements the SSH2 protocol for
secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines.  Unlike
SSL (aka TLS), the SSH2 protocol does not require heirarchical certificates
signed by a powerful central authority.  You may know SSH2 as the protocol that
replaced C{telnet} and C{rsh} for secure access to remote shells, but the
protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote
services across an encrypted tunnel.  (This is how C{sftp} works, for example.)

The high-level client API starts with creation of an L{SSHClient} object.
For more direct control, pass a socket (or socket-like object) to a
L{Transport}, and use L{start_server <Transport.start_server>} or
L{start_client <Transport.start_client>} to negoatite
with the remote host as either a server or client.  As a client, you are
responsible for authenticating using a password or private key, and checking
the server's host key.  I{(Key signature and verification is done by paramiko,
but you will need to provide private keys and check that the content of a
public key matches what you expected to see.)}  As a server, you are
responsible for deciding which users, passwords, and keys to allow, and what
kind of channels to allow.

Once you have finished, either side may request flow-controlled L{Channel}s to
the other side, which are python objects that act like sockets, but send and
receive data over the encrypted session.

Paramiko is written entirely in python (no C or platform-dependent code) and is
released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
